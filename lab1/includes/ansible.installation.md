## Installing Ansible

### Windows 7

Unfortunately, ansible is not yet supported on the *Windows 7 platform*

But don't worry, you can still work *directly* with ansible by using a *virtual machine*.

For that, we'll use *vagrant* to set up our virtual environment.

So if you're on Windows 7, skip to the next section: <a href="#" id="vagrant_introduction" class="section_link">Vagrant</a>

If you're on a Linux OS, installing ansible is fairly straight forward.

### Debian Systems

Installation on *Ubuntu* *16.04*:

!source(lab1/includes/src/ansible-install.debian.sh)(bash)

### RHEL Systems

Installation on *CentOS 7.x*, *Oracle Enterprise Linux 7.x*

!source(lab1/includes/src/ansible-install.rhel.sh)(bash)
